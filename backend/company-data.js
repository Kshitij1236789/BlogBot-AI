          # How to Plan a Destination Wedding Under ₹50 Lakh
  
          A destination wedding feels like a dream, but the budget can often feel like a nightmare. What if we told you that your dream of a picturesque wedding is achievable without breaking the bank? At Omnicassion, we specialize in turning grand visions into reality, and a destination wedding under ₹50 lakh is more than possible—it's a planning sweet spot. This guide will break down how to allocate your budget and offer creative ideas to make every rupee count.
  
          ## The Venue & Accommodation (Budget: ₹12 Lakh)
          This will be your biggest expense. Look for off-season dates to get better deals. Consider boutique hotels or resorts that offer all-inclusive packages. For a guest list of 150, this budget should comfortably cover a 2-day stay in many beautiful locations across India.
  
          ## Decor & Ambiance (Budget: ₹13 Lakh)
          Work with the natural beauty of your chosen venue.
          * **Minimalist Mandap:** A simple, elegant mandap with drapes and local flowers can be stunning.
          * **Lighting is Key:** Use fairy lights, lanterns, and candles to create a magical atmosphere.
          * **DIY Elements:** Personalized welcome signs or table centerpieces can add a personal touch and save money.
  
          ## Catering (Budget: ₹17 Lakh)
          Food is a huge part of any Indian wedding.
          * **Local Cuisine:** Opting for local delicacies is often more cost-effective and gives your guests an authentic experience.
          * **Buffet Style:** A buffet is generally more budget-friendly than a plated dinner.
          * **Smart Menu Planning:** Limit the number of live counters and focus on a well-curated menu.
  
          ## Photography & Videography (Budget: ₹3-4 Lakh)
          Capture your memories without overspending.
          * **Hire Local Talent:** Look for skilled photographers and videographers in the destination city to avoid travel and accommodation costs.
          * **Clear Deliverables:** Be clear about the number of edited photos and the length of the video you expect.

        title:"Top Event Trends to Watch in 2025",
        content:`How Events Are Getting Smarter, Bolder, and More Meaningful This Year 
                The way we celebrate is evolving—and so are expectations. Whether it’s a wedding, corporate event, influencer launch, or intimate gathering, 2025 brings a fresh wave of trends that blend tech, storytelling, sustainability, and personalization.
                At Omnicassion, we’re always ahead of the curve. Here's your insider look at what’s trending in the event world this year—and how you can integrate these into your next big celebration

                1. Experiential Events Over Formal Ones
                Forget rigid formats and one-size-fits-all itineraries. In 2025, the focus is on creating immersive guest experiences:

                * Live entertainment zones (tattoo stations, poetry corners, acoustic lounges)
                * 360-degree setups where guests are part of the scene, not just viewers
                * Interactive elements like live polls, art walls, or storytelling booths
                * Why it works: People don’t want to attend events—they want to feel them.

                2. Sustainable and Eco-Friendly Setups
                Sustainability is no longer a niche—it’s a necessity.

                * Couples and companies alike are now demanding:
                * Reusable decor (fabric drapes, metal installations)
                * Minimal plastic usage
                * Local vendors & seasonal flowers
                * Digital invites & QR code menus
                * Bonus: It’s not just great for the planet—it’s cost-effective too.


                3. Intimate Yet Impactful Gatherings
                Micro-events are booming. But small doesn’t mean dull.
                * Guest lists under 100, but with premium services
                * Bespoke entertainment: solo artists, private chefs, storytelling hosts
                * Unique venues like vineyards, boutique hotels, and private villas
                * 2025 is all about curated luxury—where every guest feels special.
  

                4. Fusion Themes Are Taking Over
                From "Retro Meets Royal" to "Boho Meets Bollywood", themes are no longer rigid. The new era is about creative mashups:
                * Boho Luxe Mehendi with earthy decor and disco balls
                * Pastel Sangeet with tech mapping and acoustic artists
                * Corporate + Cultural Mix in annual office parties

                The rule: Personalize it or lose attention.
                5. Tech is a Guest of Honour
                2025’s events will be seamlessly digital. It’s not just about screens—it’s about experience:
                * AI-based guest check-ins
                * Live drone coverage
                * AR photo booths
                * Virtual guest entries for relatives abroad
                * Event apps for schedules, maps, and vendor contact
        
                7. Drone Decor & Vertical Installations

                With rising demand for aerial photography and Instagrammable ceilings, decor is going UP:
                * Suspended floral canopies
                * Floating lights above dancefloors
                * Mandaps surrounded by water or glass reflections  
                * Design is no longer horizontal—it’s architectural.

                8. Hyper-Personalization Is Key
                Guests are no longer just attending—they want to be part of the experience:
                * Custom welcome notes
                * Personalised photo booths & digital albums
                * Return favours selected via QR codes
                * Zodiac-based table placements or food preferences
                * The more personal, the more memorable.  

                9. Local + Luxe Cuisine
                Instead of global menus, hyper-local and premium is trending:
                * Regional delicacies with modern plating
                * Live stations with chefs explaining dishes
                * Cocktail menus featuring homegrown ingredients
                * Food isn't just about taste anymore—it’s a talking point.

                10. Collaborative Planning with Tech Teams

                * Today, clients are co-creating with planners. With tools like:
                * Moodboard apps
                * Live layout visualisers
                * Digital rehearsal walkthroughs
                * At Omnicassion, we help our clients visualize and customize every part of the event journey.

                #Pro Tip from Omnicassion
                * Choose vendors who understand these trends—not just follow them.
                * Our curated list of professionals is trained in 2025-ready experiences, and we help you match the right style with your venue, budget, and guest list.


                #Real Inspiration: Trisha & Kabir’s Trend-Led Celebration
                * Trisha and Kabir didn’t want a big-fat wedding. They wanted an intimate, immersive celebration with friends and family.
                * They picked a heritage property with pastel decor, served regional cuisine in ceramic platters, and hosted poetry performances instead of DJs.
                * The standout? A live painting of their pheras, framed for guests to witness the moment again.
                * With Omnicassion by their side, their event was fresh, personal, and trend-forward—without being overwhelming.



        
        Conclusion: Don’t Just Host an Event. Design an Experience.

                * In 2025, your event needs to be more than just a schedule—it needs to be a story.
                * Whether you're hosting a destination wedding, product launch, corporate award night, or birthday gala, these trends help you connect, surprise, and delight.
                * Plan Smart. Celebrate Better. Only with Omnicassion.

        title:"Marigold Magic – Celebrating Love with Timeless Vibrance",
        content:` Weddings in India are a celebration of culture, tradition, and vibrant colors. Among the most loved and evergreen themes is the Marigold Wedding Theme — a tribute to timeless beauty and cultural roots. Marigolds, with their bright yellow and orange hues, represent positivity, purity, and prosperity, making them the ideal flower for weddings rooted in tradition.
                Whether you're hosting a vibrant mehendi function, a sunny haldi ceremony, or a daytime wedding, marigolds bring unmatched warmth and energy to every setting.
                Natural Vibrance: Their bold shades contrast beautifully with open-air locations, heritage sites, and lush garden venues.
                Budget Friendly: Being local and seasonal, marigolds are cost-effective, allowing for extravagant decor without extravagant spending.
                Symbolism: Associated with auspiciousness, devotion, and happiness, marigolds align perfectly with the essence of a wedding.

                #Designing the Perfect Marigold-Themed Wedding
                1. Venue Selection
                Opt for spaces that naturally blend with floral arrangements:
                * Courtyards and outdoor gardens
                * Heritage havelis and forts
                * Open banquet lawns with natural backdrops
                * Elite clubs like Chandigarh Club, known for its elegant outdoor lawns and colonial charm

                2. Color Palette
                Keep it warm, festive, and earthy:
                * Sunshine Yellow
                * Deep Orange
                * Muted Browns and Olive Greens
                * Accents of White or Off-white for contrast
                * Muted Browns and Olive Greens
                 
                3. Decor Highlights
                * Marigold Garlands: Use them for backdrops, mandap entrances, and draping around staircases. 
                * Floral Chandeliers: Hanging marigold bunches with fairy lights add a magical glow.
                * Rangoli Corners: Marigold-based rangolis or flower paths for entrances. 
                * Phoolon ki Holi: Plan marigold petal showers for the bride, groom, and guests for a joyful twist.
                * Accents of White or Off-white for contrast
                  

                4. Dress Code & Styling
               * Encourage guests to dress to the theme:
               * For Women: Yellow lehengas, orange sarees, or white outfits with floral embroidery.
               * For Men: Ivory kurtas with orange/yellow pocket squares or turbans.
               * The couple can stand out in off-white, ivory, or subtle golden outfits against the vibrant marigold background.

                Daytime Functions: Use natural light to your advantage — the marigold color pops under sunlight.

                
                
                #When to Choose a Marigold Theme
                Best for spring and winter weddings, when marigolds are fresh and easily available.
                Ideal for daytime functions like haldi, mehendi, or the main wedding.
                Works beautifully for couples wanting to highlight tradition with visual charm.

                #Real Wedding Inspiration: Sanya & Kunal at Chandigarh Club
                Sanya and Kunal celebrated their wedding on 15th February 2025 at the prestigious Chandigarh Club. With its sprawling lawns and colonial charm, the venue was a perfect canvas for their vibrant marigold-themed celebration.

                The haldi ceremony was set under a marigold canopy, surrounded by low seating and golden brass accents. Their mehendi function featured a floral jhoola, dholki performances, and marigold jewelry. On their big day, they walked hand-in-hand through a marigold petal aisle as friends showered flowers and blessings.

                Guests were gifted marigold seed kits — a unique gesture to let the love bloom even after the wedding. The entire affair was warm, traditional, and soaked in golden light.

                The Marigold Wedding Theme is not just about decor — it’s about emotion, culture, and creating a vibrant atmosphere full of joy. It’s flexible, festive, budget-friendly, and strikingly beautiful.

                For couples wanting an Indian wedding that feels authentic yet stunning, marigold is your flower of choice.
